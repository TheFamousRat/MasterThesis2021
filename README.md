# MasterThesis2021

Repository for my master thesis, done in the context of my MSc at the KU Leuven, in Belgium.

The goal of this thesis was to explore the effect of including information contained within the texture of a photo-scanned object into a denoising process. The denoising paradigm used was the Non-Local Similarity Low-Rank Recovery algorithm, which locates similar patches across the surface of the object, groups them together, and enforces their similarity through the solving of a low-rank problem. This similarity enforcment allows for a recovery of noise-free versions of the patches' characteristics, that can be used to update the surface so that it matches those recovered characteristics, gradually removing the noise from the surface.

The overall conclusion of the thesis was that the inclusion of texture information led to a higher similarity among the patch groups, resulting in faster low-rank recovery times and in marginally better denoising results. However, the pre-processing step of the algorithm is as of now prohibitively slow, the biggest bottleneck being the extraction of local texture pixels from each patch. The algorithm also requires a large amount of hyperparameters tweaking, which makes the method unsuitable for non-experienced users. Those rough results showed however the potential of the technique, and could likely be significantly improved upon through more efficient image extraction and hyperparameter learning.
